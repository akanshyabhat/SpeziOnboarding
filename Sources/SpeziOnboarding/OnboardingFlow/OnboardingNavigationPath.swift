/// The ``OnboardingNavigationPath`` represents one of the main components of the ``SpeziOnboarding`` package. It wraps SwiftUI's `NavigationPath` and tailors it for the use within the ``OnboardingStack`` which provides an easy-to-use interface for creating Onboarding Flows within health applications.
///
/// At the core of the ``OnboardingNavigationPath`` stands a wrapped `NavigationPath` from SwiftUI which holds path elements of type `OnboardingStepIdentifier`. Based on the onboarding views and conditions defined within the ``OnboardingStack``, the ``OnboardingNavigationPath`` enables developers to easily navigate through the onboarding procedure without repeated condition checking in every single onboarding view.
///
/// The ``OnboardingNavigationPath`` is injeceted as a SwiftUI `EnvironmentObject` into the ``OnboardingStack`` view hierachy. Resulting from that, all views declared within the ``OnboardingStack`` are able to access a single instance of the ``OnboardingNavigationPath``.
///
/// ```swift
/// struct Welcome: View {
///     @EnvironmentObject private var onboardingNavigationPath: OnboardingNavigationPath
///
///     var body: some View {
///         OnboardingView(
///             ...,
///             action: {
///                 // Automatically navigates to the next `OnboardingStep`, as outlined by the order of views within the `OnboardingStack`
///                 onboardingNavigationPath.nextStep()
///
///                 // Manually navigates to an onboarding view identified by its static type which is declared within the `OnboardingStack`. After this manual navigation step, the `OnboardingNavigationPath` will continue from the current step in the declared onboarding order within the `OnboardingStack`.
///                 onboardingNavigationPath.append(InterestingModules.self)
///
///                 // Manually navigates to a custom onboarding view which is not declared within the `OnboardingStack`. The internal onboarding state of the `OnboardingNavigationPath` won't be moved and stay at the old position.

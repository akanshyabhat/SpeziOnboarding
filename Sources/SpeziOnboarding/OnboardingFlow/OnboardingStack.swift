/// The ``OnboardingStack`` represents one of the main components of the ``SpeziOnboarding`` package. It wraps the SwiftUI `NavigationStack` and provides an easy to use API to declare the onboarding steps of health applications, eliminating the need for developers to manually determine the next to be shown step within each onboarding view (e.g. skipped steps as permissions are already granted). All of the (conditional) onboarding views are stated within the ``OnboardingStack`` from which the order of the onboarding flow is determined.
///
/// Navigation within the ``OnboardingStack`` is possible via the ``OnboardingNavigationPath`` which works quite similar to the SwiftUI `NavigationPath`. It automatically navigates to the next to-be-shown onboarding step via ``OnboardingNavigationPath/nextStep()`` or manually via  ``OnboardingNavigationPath/append(_:)``. Furthermore, one can append custom onboarding steps that are not declared within the  ``OnboardingStack`` (e.g. as the structure of these steps isn't linear) via ``OnboardingNavigationPath/append(customView:)`` or ``OnboardingNavigationPath/append(customViewInit:)``. See the ``OnboardingNavigationPath`` for more details.
/// 
/// The ``OnboardingNavigationPath`` is injected as a SwiftUI `EnvironmentObject` into the ``OnboardingStack`` view hierarchy. Resulting from that, all views declared within the ``OnboardingStack`` are able to access a single instance of the ``OnboardingNavigationPath``.
///
/// ```swift
/// struct Onboarding: View {
///     @AppStorage(StorageKeys.onboardingFlowComplete) var completedOnboardingFlow = false
///     @State private var localNotificationAuthorization = false
///
///     var body: some View {
///         OnboardingStack(onboardingFlowComplete: $completedOnboardingFlow) {
///             Welcome()
///             InterestingModules()
///
///             if HKHealthStore.isHealthDataAvailable() {
///                 HealthKitPermissions()
///             }
///
///             if !localNotificationAuthorization {
///                 NotificationPermissions()
///             }
///         }
///         .task {
///             localNotificationAuthorization = await ...
